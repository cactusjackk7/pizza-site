![Unit test](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/workflows/Unit%20Tests/badge.svg)

Made this site for school. We had to make a site for a person who wanted a online pizza-store. 


We had to make a database too. I got a [database](https://github.com/ai-santos/pizza-database) from github

------------------------------------

I made the site with HTML/CSS and JavaScript. We had a one and a half month the time to make it.
(07-03-2021)Still have time to finish it. This is my "preversion" of the site. I think its done, but maybe in the future i may be changing it. 

--------------------------------------------------

The site must have a cookies sessions, in the site and the shopping cart. We have to make the cookies in PHP.
